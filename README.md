Short Project Explanation

MoveUp is a simple web app that uses AI pose detection to help users stretch their upper body correctly. It guides the user through four basic stretches (neck, shoulders, back, arms) and gives quick feedback if the posture is incorrect. The goal is to reduce muscle tension for people who sit for long periods and make stretching easy, safe, and accessible.
